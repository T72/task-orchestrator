## Stop Fighting Task Dependencies

**Many teams report spending up to 30% of development time on coordination. Task Orchestrator can help significantly reduce this overhead.**

When multiple developers and AI agents work on the same codebase, coordination becomes challenging. Tasks often block each other. Context can get lost. Simple changes sometimes cascade into larger delays.

Task Orchestrator helps by automatically managing dependencies, unblocking work when prerequisites complete, and maintaining context across your team.

## What You Get

- **Reduced Blocking**: Dependencies resolve automatically - when task A completes, task B can be unblocked
- **Better Context**: Tasks carry shared context between agents, eliminating re-explanation
- **AI Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents can share progress, maintain private notes, and coordinate seamlessly
- **Improved Parallel Work**: Multiple developers and AI agents work together without conflicts
- **Real-Time Orchestration**: Watch command enables instant coordination when tasks unblock
- **Minimal Setup**: Simple configuration, Python standard library only
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with Python 3.8+

## ‚ö° Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup (30 seconds)
git clone https://github.com/T72/task-orchestrator.git
cd task-orchestrator
chmod +x tm  # Make executable (Linux/Mac) or use: python3 tm

# 2. Initialize (instant)
./tm init  # Or: python3 tm init

# 3. Your first orchestrated workflow (90 seconds)
SETUP=$(./tm add "Setup environment")  # Returns task ID: abc12345
./tm add "Run tests" --depends-on $SETUP
./tm add "Deploy" --depends-on $SETUP --file deploy.sh:15

# Watch the magic happen
./tm list
./tm complete $SETUP  # Automatically unblocks dependent tasks!
```

That's it! You're ready to start organizing your tasks more effectively.

## üí° Real-World Usage

### Reduce Dependency Blocking
```bash
# Create a feature that requires backend ‚Üí frontend ‚Üí tests
API=$(./tm add "Create API endpoints" | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
UI=$(./tm add "Build UI" --depends-on $API | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
TEST=$(./tm add "Integration tests" --depends-on $UI | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')

# When you complete the API, the UI task automatically unblocks
./tm complete $API
# Now your frontend developer can immediately start working
```

### Track Exactly What Code Needs Work
```bash
# Link tasks to specific code locations
./tm add "Fix memory leak" --file src/cache.py:234 --priority critical

# See all tasks affecting specific files
./tm list --has-files
# Shows: "Fix memory leak - src/cache.py:234" with direct line reference
```

### Multiple Developers, Zero Conflicts
```bash
# Developer 1 creates the main feature
FEATURE=$(./tm add "Payment system")

# Developer 2 claims and starts work
./tm assign $FEATURE dev2
./tm update $FEATURE --status in_progress

# Developer 3 watches for completion
./tm watch  # Gets instant notification when payment system is ready
```

## ü§ñ AI Agent Orchestration

Task Orchestrator is designed for the era of AI-powered development, where multiple specialized agents work together on complex tasks.

### Shared Context - No More Copy-Pasting

When you delegate a task to an agent, you can provide rich context that travels with the task:

```bash
# Provide context when creating a task
./tm add "Implement OAuth2 authentication" \
  --context "Use existing User model, integrate with Google & GitHub providers" \
  --assignee backend-agent

# The backend agent receives all context automatically
# No need to re-explain requirements to each new agent
```

### Private Agent Notes - Clean Reasoning Space

Agents can maintain private notes during their work without cluttering the shared space:

```bash
# Agent adds private reasoning notes
./tm note $TASK_ID --private "Considering JWT vs session tokens. 
JWT better for our stateless architecture. Checking token rotation strategy..."

# These notes help agents reason through problems
# Other agents see results, not the entire thought process
```

### Real-Time Orchestration

An orchestrating agent can monitor and coordinate multiple specialists:

```bash
# Orchestrator watches for tasks to unblock
./tm watch

# When backend agent completes authentication:
# > "Task 'OAuth2 authentication' completed. Task 'Frontend login UI' now unblocked."

# Orchestrator immediately assigns to frontend specialist
./tm assign $FRONTEND_TASK frontend-agent
```

### Progress Transparency

Agents share progress updates, enabling smooth handoffs:

```bash
# Database agent updates progress
./tm progress $TASK_ID "Schema designed, 3/5 tables created"

# Backend agent can see exactly where things stand
./tm show $TASK_ID
# Shows: "In Progress: Schema designed, 3/5 tables created"
```

This enables true parallel development where specialized agents (database, backend, frontend, testing) work simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes.
