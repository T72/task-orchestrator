## üéØ WHY: Our Mission

**We believe that complex software development should be orchestrated, not chaotic.**

In today's world of parallel development, multi-agent AI systems, and distributed teams, task coordination has become the critical bottleneck. We exist to transform task management from a burden into a competitive advantage.

### The Problem We Solve

Modern development faces unprecedented coordination challenges:
- **Parallel Work Conflicts**: Multiple developers and AI agents working simultaneously create dependency chaos
- **Context Loss**: Critical information gets buried in tickets, chat, and disconnected tools
- **Integration Friction**: Teams waste 30% of their time on coordination overhead
- **Brittle Workflows**: One blocked task cascades into project-wide delays

### Our Purpose

Task Orchestrator eliminates coordination waste by providing a single source of truth for task dependencies, enabling teams and AI agents to work in perfect harmony. We maximize delivered value by focusing on what matters: getting work done, not managing it.

## üöÄ HOW: Our Approach

We achieve orchestration excellence through **LEAN principles** and **radical simplicity**:

### Core Principles

1. **Zero Waste Philosophy**
   - No external dependencies (Python stdlib only)
   - No configuration overhead (works out of the box)
   - No learning curve (Unix-style CLI)

2. **Value-First Design**
   - Every feature must eliminate coordination waste
   - Automatic dependency resolution prevents blocking
   - File-level tracking connects tasks to actual code

3. **Continuous Flow**
   - Lock-free concurrent access for parallel work
   - Instant notification when blockers clear
   - Seamless handoffs between agents and developers

4. **Built-In Resilience**
   - ACID-compliant SQLite for data integrity
   - Automatic recovery from failures
   - Cross-worktree synchronization

## üõ†Ô∏è WHAT: The Task Orchestrator

A lightweight, powerful orchestration system that transforms how teams and AI agents coordinate work.

### Key Capabilities

- **üîÑ Smart Dependencies**: Automatic resolution, circular prevention, instant unblocking
- **üîí Concurrent Safe**: ACID-compliant with safe multi-agent access
- **üìÅ Code-Aware**: Direct file and line number references for precise context
- **üåê Cross-Platform**: Linux, macOS, Windows - zero configuration needed
- **üìä Export Ready**: JSON and Markdown for seamless tool integration
- **üè∑Ô∏è Flexible Organization**: Tags, priorities, and custom metadata

## ‚ö° Quick Start (2 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup (30 seconds)
git clone https://github.com/T72/task-orchestrator.git
cd task-orchestrator
chmod +x tm

# 2. Initialize (instant)
./tm init

# 3. Your first orchestrated workflow (90 seconds)
SETUP=$(./tm add "Setup environment" | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
./tm add "Run tests" --depends-on $SETUP
./tm add "Deploy" --depends-on $SETUP --file deploy.sh:15

# Watch the magic happen
./tm list
./tm complete $SETUP  # Automatically unblocks dependent tasks!
```

That's it! You're orchestrating. No configuration, no dependencies, just results.

## üí° Core Usage Patterns

### Eliminate Blocking - Dependency Chains
```bash
# Create a feature workflow that never blocks
API=$(./tm add "Create API endpoints" | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
UI=$(./tm add "Build UI" --depends-on $API | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
TEST=$(./tm add "Integration tests" --depends-on $UI | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')

# Complete API work ‚Üí UI automatically unblocks ‚Üí Tests automatically unblock
./tm complete $API --impact-review
```

### Maximize Context - File-Aware Tasks
```bash
# Connect tasks directly to code
./tm add "Fix memory leak" --file src/cache.py:234 --priority critical
./tm add "Refactor auth module" --file src/auth.py:100:250

# See exactly what needs attention
./tm list --has-files
```

### Enable Parallel Work - Multi-Agent Coordination
```bash
# Agent 1: Create main task
MAIN=$(./tm add "User dashboard" | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')

# Agent 2: Pick up and work
./tm assign $MAIN agent2
./tm update $MAIN --status in_progress

# Agent 3: Get notified when ready
./tm watch  # Real-time notifications when blockers clear
```
