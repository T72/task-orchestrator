**Your AI agents are waiting for each other. Your developers are blocked. You're copying context between tasks.**

## This Changes Today

Task Orchestrator enables true parallel work. When one task completes, all dependent tasks instantly unblock. Context travels automatically. Each project stays isolated.

## 2-Minute Setup That Saves Hours

```bash
git clone https://github.com/T72/task-orchestrator.git
cd task-orchestrator
./tm init

# Watch the magic
BACKEND=$(./tm add "API endpoints" | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
FRONTEND=$(./tm add "React UI" --depends-on $BACKEND | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')
TESTS=$(./tm add "Integration tests" --depends-on $BACKEND | grep -o '[a-f0-9]\{8\}')

# Backend completes â†’ Frontend AND Tests unblock simultaneously
./tm complete $BACKEND
./tm list  # See both tasks ready!
```

## Why Teams Switch to Task Orchestrator

### ðŸš€ Instant Unblocking
No more "waiting for backend". Dependencies resolve automatically the moment upstream tasks complete.

### ðŸ§  Context That Travels
Stop copy-pasting requirements. Context, decisions, and discoveries stay with the task through every handoff.

### ðŸ”’ True Project Isolation  
Work on 5 clients simultaneously. Each project's tasks stay in their own `.task-orchestrator/` directory.

### ðŸ¤– Built for AI-First Teams
Multiple AI agents coordinate without conflicts. Private notes for reasoning. Shared context for results.

## The Killer Features

### ðŸ“‹ Templates Save 30 Minutes Per Sprint
```bash
# Apply your sprint template in seconds
./tm template apply sprint.yaml --var sprint=5 --var feature="Payments"
# Creates 6 dependent tasks instantly
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Wizard
```bash
./tm wizard         # Guided creation for complex workflows
./tm wizard --quick # Expert mode for power users
```

### ðŸ“Š Real-Time Progress
```bash
./tm watch          # Monitor all tasks live
./tm progress $ID "50% - API schema defined"
```
