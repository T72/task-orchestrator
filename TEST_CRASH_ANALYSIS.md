# Test Crash Analysis Report

## Summary
The WSL environment crash appears to be related to specific test behaviors. Here's the analysis:

## Test Results

| Test File | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| test_tm.sh | **CRASHED** | Crashed at "Initialize database" step |
| test_edge_cases.sh | ERROR | tm executable not found after temp dir change |
| stress_test.sh | ERROR | tm executable not found after temp dir change |
| test_context_sharing.sh | **CRASHED** | Crashed at "Context Sharing Feature Tests" |
| additional_edge_tests.sh | **TIMEOUT/HANG** | Test hung and had to be terminated |
| test_collaboration.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |
| test_agent_specialization.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |
| test_durability.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |
| test_event_driven.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |
| test_hooks.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |
| test_isolation.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |
| test_orchestration_integration.sh | UNKNOWN | Could not test properly |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Initialization Crash (test_tm.sh)
- The crash occurs during SQLite database initialization
- This suggests potential SQLite/filesystem interaction issues in WSL

### 2. Context Sharing Test Crash (test_context_sharing.sh)
- Crashes during context sharing feature tests
- May involve file locking or shared memory issues

### 3. Additional Edge Tests Hang (additional_edge_tests.sh)
- Test hangs indefinitely
- Likely involves deadlock or infinite loop scenario

## Root Cause Analysis

The crashes appear to be related to:
1. **SQLite operations in isolated temp directories** - Database operations in mktemp directories may trigger WSL filesystem bugs
2. **File locking mechanisms** - The task orchestrator uses file-based locking which may conflict with WSL's filesystem layer
3. **Resource exhaustion** - Tests may be creating resources faster than WSL can handle

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Workarounds
1. **Run tests individually with longer delays between them**
2. **Add explicit cleanup between tests**
3. **Reduce parallel operations in tests**

### Code Modifications Needed

1. **Add WSL detection and special handling**:
```bash
if grep -qi microsoft /proc/version; then
    export TM_WSL_MODE=1
    # Add delays and extra cleanup
fi
```

2. **Modify database initialization to be more defensive**:
- Add retries with exponential backoff
- Check for database lock issues
- Add explicit sync calls after database operations

3. **Fix path resolution issues**:
- Tests lose track of tm executable when changing directories
- Need to use absolute paths or copy tm to test directory

4. **Add resource limits**:
- Limit number of concurrent database connections
- Add memory usage monitoring
- Implement process limits

## Safe Testing Approach

To safely run tests without crashing WSL:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Safe test runner for WSL

TESTS=(
    "test_tm.sh"
    "test_edge_cases.sh"
    "stress_test.sh"
    "test_context_sharing.sh"
    "additional_edge_tests.sh"
    "test_collaboration.sh"
    "test_agent_specialization.sh"
    "test_durability.sh"
    "test_event_driven.sh"
    "test_hooks.sh"
    "test_isolation.sh"
    "test_orchestration_integration.sh"
)

for test in "${TESTS[@]}"; do
    echo "Running $test..."
    
    # Run with timeout and resource limits
    timeout 30 bash -c "
        ulimit -n 1024  # Limit file descriptors
        ulimit -u 100   # Limit processes
        ./tests/$test
    "
    
    # Clean up any leftover resources
    sleep 2
    sync
    
    # Kill any orphaned processes
    pkill -f "tm_test" || true
done
```

## Conclusion

The WSL crashes are caused by resource-intensive operations in the test suite, particularly:
- Database initialization in temporary directories
- File locking operations
- Lack of proper cleanup between tests

The tests need to be modified to be more WSL-friendly with proper resource management and cleanup.
