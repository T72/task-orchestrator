# CRITICAL JUSTIFICATIONS SUMMARY
# ====================
# 1. .task-orchestrator/ - Contains actual user task data and private information
# 2. archive/ - Old development docs that may reveal internal decisions
# 3. *.env* - Environment variables often contain API keys and secrets
# 4. *.db - SQLite databases contain actual user data
# 5. .claude/checkpoints/ - Contains task execution state and context
# 6. *-notes.md - Private agent reasoning and notes
# 7. sessions/ - Development session data with potentially sensitive paths
# 8. All compiled/cached files - Not needed and may leak system info
# 9. All IDE/OS files - Personal preferences and system-specific
# 10. All backup/temp files - May contain outdated sensitive data
