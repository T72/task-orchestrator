# PRD Validation Scripts

This directory contains validation scripts to test the current implementation against each PRD version's requirements. These scripts ensure no requirements were lost during the evolution from v1.0 to v2.3.

## Scripts Available

| Script | PRD Version | Requirements | Success Rate |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| `test_v1.0_requirements.sh` | v1.0 | 21 requirements | 66% (14/21) |
| `test_v2.0_requirements.sh` | v2.0 | 34 requirements | 73% (25/34) |
| `test_v2.1_requirements.sh` | v2.1 | 32 requirements | 46% (15/32) |
| `test_v2.2_requirements.sh` | v2.2 | 23 requirements | 73% (17/23) |
| `test_v2.3_requirements.sh` | v2.3 | 33 requirements | 81% (27/33) |

## Usage

Run individual version validation:
```bash
# Test against specific PRD version
./tests/prd-validation/test_v2.3_requirements.sh

# Test all versions in sequence
for version in v1.0 v2.0 v2.1 v2.2 v2.3; do
    echo "Testing $version..."
    ./tests/prd-validation/test_${version}_requirements.sh
done
```

## Analysis

See `comprehensive_requirements_evolution_analysis.md` for complete analysis of:
- Requirements evolution patterns
- Lost capabilities across versions  
- Architecture transformation impacts
- Recommendations for integration

## Key Findings

1. **v2.3 has highest success rate** (81%) with comprehensive Core Loop features
2. **v2.1 shows dramatic drop** (46%) due to Foundation Layer architectural shift
3. **Several v1.0 orchestration capabilities lost** and never recovered
4. **Integration opportunity exists** to merge best capabilities from all versions

## Maintenance

These scripts should be run:
- Before major releases
- When implementing new requirements
- When refactoring architecture
- When investigating capability gaps

Update scripts when:
- New PRD versions are created
- Requirements change or evolve
- Implementation structure changes
- New test patterns are needed
