## Additional Test Coverage

### Edge Cases Tested
- Empty task titles (validation)
- Invalid status values
- Non-existent dependencies
- Non-existent task operations
- Invalid priorities
- Multiple file references
- Concurrent dependency resolution
- Large-scale operations (100+ tasks)

### Integration Scenarios Tested
1. **Feature Development Workflow**: Complete lifecycle from planning to deployment
2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents working on shared tasks
3. **Dependency Chains**: Complex dependency graphs with multiple levels
4. **Impact Analysis**: File reference overlaps and impact notifications
5. **Context Sharing**: Full collaboration features working together
6. **Filtering and Export**: All filter combinations with large datasets
7. **Performance**: Bulk operations, concurrent access, large exports

### Performance Benchmarks Tested
- Create 100 tasks: < 20 seconds
- List 100+ tasks: < 5 seconds
- Export large dataset: < 5 seconds
- Bulk operations: < 10 seconds for 50 tasks
