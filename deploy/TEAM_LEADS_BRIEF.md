- **Real-time awareness** of dependencies and blockers

## üì¶ Deployment Package Available

### Package Location
```
/mnt/d/Dropbox/Private/Pers√∂nlich/VSCodeEnv/projects/task-orchestrator/deploy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-orchestrator-deploy-1.0.0-20250819_213218.tar.gz  # Timestamped package
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task-orchestrator-deploy-latest.tar.gz                # Latest symlink
```

**Recommended:** Use the latest symlink for consistency: `task-orchestrator-deploy-latest.tar.gz`

### Package Contents
- ‚úÖ Production-ready executable (`tm`)
- ‚úÖ Complete source code (`src/` directory)
- ‚úÖ Claude Code integration template (`CLAUDE_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md`)
- ‚úÖ Automated installer (`install.sh`)
- ‚úÖ Internal quickstart guide (`QUICKSTART_INTERNAL.md`)
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation (`docs/` directory)
- ‚úÖ Working examples and API reference

## üöÄ Quick Integration (5 Minutes Per Project)

### Step 1: Deploy to Project
```bash
# Extract deployment package
tar -xzf /mnt/d/Dropbox/Private/Pers√∂nlich/VSCodeEnv/projects/task-orchestrator/deploy/task-orchestrator-deploy-latest.tar.gz

# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run installer
./task-orchestrator-deploy/install.sh .
```

### Step 2: Verify Integration
```bash
# Test basic functionality
./tm init
./tm add "Integration test"
./tm list
```

### Step 3: Enable Claude Code Integration
```bash
# CRITICAL: Ensure CLAUDE.md is in project root
# This enables automatic multi-agent coordination
ls CLAUDE.md  # Should exist after installation
```

## ü§ñ What This Changes for Your Teams

### Before Task Orchestrator
‚ùå Claude agents lose context between sessions  
‚ùå No coordination between different Claude instances  
‚ùå Manual dependency tracking  
‚ùå Duplicate work from lack of awareness  
‚ùå Lost progress due to session timeouts  

### After Task Orchestrator
‚úÖ **Persistent agent memory** - Context survives restarts  
‚úÖ **Multi-agent coordination** - Automatic communication  
‚úÖ **Intelligent dependencies** - Auto-blocking/unblocking  
‚úÖ **Real-time notifications** - Immediate change awareness  
‚úÖ **File-aware tracking** - Know exactly what's affected  

### Example Multi-Agent Workflow
```bash
# Developer Request: "Add user authentication"

# Claude Agent 1 (Architecture Session)
EPIC=$(./tm add "User Authentication" -p high)
./tm add "Database schema" --depends-on $EPIC
./tm share $EPIC "Using JWT + PostgreSQL approach"

# Claude Agent 2 (Backend Session - different time/session)
# Automatically sees context and unblocked tasks
./tm join $DB_TASK
./tm context $DB_TASK  # Sees architecture decisions
./tm share $DB_TASK "Database implementation complete"

# Claude Agent 3 (Frontend Session - later)
# API task automatically unblocks when database completes
./tm join $API_TASK  
./tm context $API_TASK  # Full history available
```

## üìä Expected ROI for Your Teams
