# Task Orchestrator Release Status

## üö´ RELEASE DECISION: NOT READY FOR RELEASE

**Current Version**: 0.1.0-alpha (NOT 1.0.0)  
**Status**: ALPHA - Critical Issues Blocking Release  
**Recommendation**: DO NOT RELEASE  

## Critical Blockers for Release

### 1. ‚ùå **Core Functionality Broken**
- `show` command doesn't exist (AttributeError)
- Dependency tracking partially broken
- No input validation (accepts empty task titles)
- Multiple command implementations missing

### 2. ‚ùå **Test Failures**
- **test_tm.sh**: Only 85% pass (3/20 fail)
- **additional_edge_tests.sh**: Only 25% pass (6/8 fail)
- **test_edge_cases.sh**: Multiple validation failures
- Core features failing in production tests

### 3. ‚ùå **Documentation Misleading**
- CHANGELOG claims v1.0.0 release - **FALSE**
- README advertises features that don't work
- Release notes describe non-functional capabilities
- No warning about ALPHA status

## Release Documentation Status

### ‚úÖ What Exists:
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Present but misleading (claims 1.0.0)
- **README.md** - Comprehensive but overpromises
- **RELEASE_NOTES.md** - Professional but inaccurate
- **Documentation structure** - Good organization

### ‚ùå What's Wrong:
- Documentation claims production readiness
- No ALPHA/BETA warnings
- Features advertised that don't work
- Version number incorrect (should be 0.1.0-alpha)

## Required Actions Before ANY Release

### Immediate (Before Alpha Release):
1. **Update all documentation to reflect ALPHA status**
   - Change version to 0.1.0-alpha
   - Add prominent warnings about limitations
   - List known issues clearly
   - Remove claims of features that don't work

2. **Fix critical bugs**
   - Implement `show` command
   - Fix dependency tracking
   - Add input validation
   - Complete command implementations

3. **Update tests**
   - Fix failing tests or document why they fail
   - Achieve minimum 90% pass rate for core features

### For Beta Release (0.5.0-beta):
- All core commands working
- 95% test pass rate
- Error handling complete
- Basic logging implemented

### For Production Release (1.0.0):
- 100% core feature tests passing
- Complete documentation
- Performance optimization
- Security audit completed
- Migration system in place

## Current State vs. Claims

| Feature | Documentation Claims | Actual State |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| Dependency Management | ‚úÖ "Automatic resolution" | ‚ùå Partially broken |
| Show Task Details | ‚úÖ "Full CRUD operations" | ‚ùå Not implemented |
| Input Validation | ‚úÖ "Robust validation" | ‚ùå Accepts empty titles |
| Export Features | ‚úÖ "JSON and Markdown" | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially working |
| Test Coverage | ‚úÖ "Comprehensive test suite" | ‚ùå Many tests fail |

## Recommended Communication

If releasing as ALPHA (not recommended yet):

```markdown
# Task Orchestrator 0.1.0-alpha

‚ö†Ô∏è **ALPHA SOFTWARE - NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is an early alpha release with significant limitations:
- Many features incomplete or broken
- Test coverage insufficient
- Not suitable for critical workflows
- Data loss possible

Known Issues:
- `show` command not implemented
- Dependency tracking unreliable
- No input validation
- Many tests failing

Use at your own risk for experimentation only.
```

## Final Verdict

**DO NOT RELEASE as 1.0.0** - This would damage credibility.

**Options:**
1. Fix critical issues first (2-3 weeks), then release as 0.5.0-beta
2. Release as 0.1.0-alpha with clear warnings (not recommended)
3. Continue development to reach true 1.0.0 quality (4-6 weeks)

**Recommendation**: Option 3 - Continue development to reach production quality before any release.
