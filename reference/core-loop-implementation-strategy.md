# Core Loop First Implementation Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the approved implementation strategy for enhancing Task Orchestrator with task delegation framework capabilities. The strategy follows a "Core Loop First with Progressive Enhancement" approach, prioritizing minimal viable enhancements that deliver maximum value while maintaining system simplicity.

## Strategic Principles

### 1. Minimal Viable Enhancement
- Add only features that demonstrably reduce friction
- Every addition must justify its complexity cost
- Default to "no" for features that can wait

### 2. Data-Driven Evolution
- Implement telemetry before features
- Let usage patterns guide development
- Build what users pull, not what frameworks push

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
- Simple tasks remain simple
- Complexity available but not required
- Advanced features behind explicit flags

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- All changes are additive
- Existing workflows continue unchanged
- Migration is optional, not forced

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation Layer (Week 1)
**Objective**: Add data fields without changing behavior

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Non-breaking schema extensions
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN success_criteria TEXT;     -- JSON array
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN deadline TEXT;             -- ISO 8601
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN completion_summary TEXT;   -- Free text
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN estimated_hours INTEGER;   -- Optional
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN actual_hours INTEGER;      -- Optional
```

**Rationale**:
- Zero disruption to existing workflows
- Enables immediate data capture
- Creates foundation for future features
- Allows organic pattern emergence

### Phase 1: Success Definition Loop (Weeks 2-3)
**Objective**: Implement success criteria with validation

**Core Features**:
1. Success criteria definition at task creation
2. Criteria validation at completion
3. Simple pass/fail reporting

**Implementation Example**:
```python
# Define criteria
tm add "Implement auth" --criteria '[
  {"criterion": "OAuth2 support", "measurable": "auth/oauth2 endpoint returns 200"},
  {"criterion": "Test coverage", "measurable": "coverage >= 80%"}
]'

# Validate at completion
tm complete <id> --validate --summary "OAuth2 and SAML implemented"
# Output: ✓ OAuth2 support (verified)
#         ✗ Test coverage (75% < 80%)
#         Completion blocked: 1 criteria unmet
```

**Why This First**:
- Highest ROI - directly prevents rework
- AI-agent compatible (binary validation)
- Self-contained feature
- Immediate measurable impact

### Phase 2: Feedback Mechanism (Week 4)
**Objective**: Lightweight quality signals

**Core Features**:
1. Simple numeric scores (1-5)
2. Optional text feedback
3. Basic aggregation metrics

**Implementation Example**:
```python
# Provide feedback
tm feedback <id> --quality 4 --timeliness 5 --note "Well structured"

# View metrics
tm metrics --feedback
# Average Quality: 4.2/5.0 (25 tasks)
# Average Timeliness: 4.7/5.0
# Tasks with feedback: 67%
```

**Why This Next**:
- Creates learning signal
- Minimal overhead
- Enables continuous improvement
- No workflow disruption

### Phase 3: Smart Defaults via Context (Weeks 5-6)
**Objective**: Template emergence through usage

**Core Features**:
1. Context-based templates
2. Pattern recognition
3. Suggested defaults

**Implementation Example**:
```yaml
# .task-orchestrator/context/templates/auth-task.yaml
template:
  type: authentication
  success_criteria:
    - "Supports specified auth methods"
    - "Response time < 200ms"
    - "Security scan passes"
  estimated_hours: 8
  
# Usage
tm add "Build login" --template auth-task
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Leverages existing infrastructure
- Templates emerge from actual usage
- No new systems to learn
- Natural evolution

## Decision Gate: 30-Day Assessment

After Phase 2 implementation, conduct assessment:

### Metrics to Gather
1. **Success Criteria Usage**
   - % of tasks with criteria defined
   - Average criteria per task
   - % of criteria validated at completion

2. **Feedback Adoption**
   - % of completed tasks with feedback
   - Score distribution patterns
   - Correlation with rework

3. **Completion Summaries**
   - % of tasks with summaries
   - Average summary length
   - Knowledge reuse patterns

### Decision Criteria for Phase 4
Proceed with additional features only if:
- Success criteria adoption > 60%
- Feedback provided on > 40% of tasks
- Users request specific enhancements
- Clear patterns emerge from usage data

## What We're NOT Building (And Why)

### Intentionally Excluded Features

1. **Complex Review Workflows**
   - Why not: Adds bureaucracy without clear value
   - Alternative: Simple feedback scores suffice

2. **Formal Evaluation Gates**
   - Why not: Slows velocity, frustrates agents
   - Alternative: Success criteria provide objective gates

3. **Elaborate Metrics Dashboards**
   - Why not: Premature optimization
   - Alternative: Basic aggregates meet immediate needs

4. **Understanding Confirmation Ceremonies**
   - Why not: Agents don't misunderstand like humans
   - Alternative: Success criteria clarify expectations

5. **Team Retrospective Tools**
   - Why not: Out of scope for orchestration
   - Alternative: External tools better suited

### The 80/20 Rule Applied

**These 3 features deliver 80% of value:**
- Success criteria (prevents rework)
- Completion summaries (captures knowledge)
- Feedback scores (enables improvement)

**These 9 features add only 20% more value:**
- Review cycles
- Evaluation workflows
- Check-in scheduling
- Rework categorization
- Understanding confirmations
- Autonomy indicators
- Team retrospectives
- Complex dashboards
- Rigid templates

## Risk Mitigation

### Escape Hatches
```bash
# Disable all enhancements
tm config --minimal-mode

# Rollback schema changes
tm migrate --rollback

# Export data before migration
tm export --include-new-fields
```

### Progressive Configuration
```bash
# Enable features selectively
tm config --enable success-criteria
tm config --enable feedback
tm config --disable templates

# Team mode for human workflows
tm config --enable-team-mode  # Unlocks human-centric features
```

### Telemetry and Learning
```python
# Anonymous usage tracking
{
  "feature": "success_criteria",
  "usage_count": 142,
  "validation_rate": 0.73,
  "prevented_rework": 12
}
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success (Success Criteria)
- 50%+ task creation includes criteria
- 20%+ reduction in task rework
- 90%+ of criteria are measurable

### Phase 2 Success (Feedback)
- 40%+ completed tasks receive feedback
- Clear correlation between scores and rework
- Feedback drives measurable improvements

### Phase 3 Success (Templates)
- 30%+ tasks use templates
- Template usage reduces creation time
- Organic template evolution observed

## System Dynamics

### Positive Feedback Loops Created
1. **Quality Loop**: Success Criteria → Less Rework → More Time → Better Criteria
2. **Learning Loop**: Feedback → Agent Improvement → Higher Scores → Better Outcomes
3. **Knowledge Loop**: Summaries → Shared Knowledge → Faster Tasks → More Summaries

### Negative Loops Avoided
1. **Not Creating**: Complex Forms → Abandonment → Workarounds → Technical Debt
2. **Not Creating**: Forced Workflows → Resistance → Shadow Systems → Fragmentation
3. **Not Creating**: Feature Creep → Complexity → Maintenance Burden → Stagnation

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Keep changes additive only
2. Default all new fields to optional
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Add telemetry before features
5. Document escape hatches

### For Users
1. Adopt features gradually
2. Start with success criteria
3. Add feedback when comfortable
4. Templates emerge from usage
5. Customize to your workflow

## Conclusion

The Core Loop First strategy delivers maximum value with minimum complexity by:
1. Adding only essential quality mechanisms
2. Maintaining system simplicity
3. Enabling data-driven evolution
4. Respecting user autonomy
5. Preserving optionality

**The key insight**: The best task orchestration system is one that enhances work without constraining it. By implementing a minimal quality loop and letting usage guide evolution, we create a system that adapts to users rather than forcing users to adapt to it.
