- `docs/guides/` - User documentation
- `docs/examples/` - Usage examples
- `docs/reference/` - API documentation
- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `tm` executable script

#### Always Excluded (Waste Prevention)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Private development workflows
- `docs/architecture/` - Internal design decisions
- `docs/protocols/` - Development protocols
- `*-notes.md` - Private agent reasoning
- `archive/` - Development history
- Development sessions, user data, logs, cache files

## üìã Workflow Documentation (LEAN-Optimized)

### Daily Development (No Changes Required)
```bash
git checkout develop
# Continue normal development with full CLAUDE.md usage
git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement feature"
```
**Benefit**: Zero disruption to existing development workflow

### Public Release Process (Automated)
```bash
./scripts/create-public-release.sh v2.6.0
./scripts/validate-public-release.sh
# Navigate to public repo and push to GitHub
```
**Benefit**: Reduced release time from 2-3 hours to 5-10 minutes
