# PRD v2.3 Summary: Core Loop Enhancement

## What Changed from v2.2 to v2.3

### Preserved (100% of v2.2)
- ✅ All 26 functional requirements (FR-CORE-1 through FR-026)
- ✅ All 5 non-functional requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-005)
- ✅ All 3 user experience requirements (UX-001 through UX-003)
- ✅ All 4 technical requirements (TECH-001 through TECH-004)
- ✅ All 4 risk mitigations (RISK-001 through RISK-004)

### Added (Core Loop Enhancement)
- ✅ 3 strategic requirements for progressive enhancement
- ✅ 13 new functional requirements for quality loop
- ✅ 6 explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep

## The Core Loop in 3 Steps

### 1. Define Success (FR-029, FR-030)
```bash
tm add "Build auth" --criteria '[{"criterion": "OAuth2 works", "measurable": "returns 200"}]'
tm complete task_id --validate  # Checks criteria before completion
```

### 2. Capture Knowledge (FR-032)
```bash
tm complete task_id --summary "OAuth2 implemented, SAML more complex than expected"
```

### 3. Enable Learning (FR-033, FR-034)
```bash
tm feedback task_id --quality 4 --timeliness 5
tm metrics --feedback  # Shows trends
```

## Key Design Decisions

### What We're Building
- **Success criteria validation** - Prevent rework through clear expectations
- **Completion summaries** - Capture knowledge for future reference
- **Lightweight feedback** - Simple 1-5 scores, no complex workflows
- **Usage telemetry** - Anonymous data to guide future development
- **Progressive enhancement** - All features optional and independent

### What We're NOT Building
- ❌ Complex review workflows (EX-001)
- ❌ Formal evaluation gates (EX-002)
- ❌ Understanding confirmations (EX-003)
- ❌ Elaborate dashboards (EX-004)
- ❌ Rigid templates (EX-005)
- ❌ Team retrospectives (EX-006)

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Week | Focus | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | 1 | Foundation (schema only) | FR-027, FR-028 |
| 1 | 2-3 | Success Criteria | FR-029 to FR-032 |
| 2 | 4 | Feedback Mechanism | FR-033 to FR-035 |
| 3 | 5 | Assessment & Decision | FR-036, FR-037 |

## Backward Compatibility Guarantee

### Existing Commands Still Work
```bash
tm add "Task"          # Works exactly as before
tm complete task_id    # Works exactly as before
tm list               # Works exactly as before
```

### New Options Are Optional
```bash
tm add "Task" --criteria '[...]'  # Optional enhancement
tm complete task_id --validate    # Optional enhancement
tm feedback task_id --quality 4   # New optional command
```

## Success Metrics

### Must Achieve by Day 30
- 50%+ tasks use success criteria
- 40%+ tasks receive feedback
- 20%+ reduction in rework
- 0 breaking changes

### Decision Gate
After 30 days, analyze telemetry to decide:
- Should we build more features?
- What patterns emerged?
- What do users actually want?

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Safety
- All new fields nullable
- Full migration rollback capability
- Telemetry can be disabled
- Minimal mode available

### Adoption Safety
- Nothing forced on users
- Progressive disclosure
- Clear value proposition
- Escape hatches everywhere

## Files Created for v2.3

1. **Strategy Document**: `/docs/reference/core-loop-implementation-strategy.md`
   - Philosophical approach and rationale

2. **Gap Analysis**: `/docs/reference/gap-analysis-task-delegation-framework.md`
   - 12 gaps identified between framework and current state

3. **PRD v2.3**: `/docs/specifications/requirements/PRD-CORE-LOOP-v2.3.md`
   - Complete requirements specification (64 total requirements)

4. **Validation Report**: `/docs/reference/prd-v2.3-validation.md`
   - Proves 100% v2.2 preservation

5. **This Summary**: `/docs/reference/prd-v2.3-summary.md`
   - Executive overview of changes

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** PRD v2.3
2. **Begin Phase 0** implementation (schema extensions)
3. **Enable telemetry** from day 1
4. **Monitor adoption** continuously
5. **Assess at day 30** for Phase 4 decision

## Bottom Line

**PRD v2.3 = PRD v2.2 + Minimal Quality Loop**

- Nothing removed
- Nothing broken
- Everything optional
- Data drives decisions
