## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Incorrect documentation causes data loss | Medium | Critical | Test all examples, emphasize backups |
| Users can't find features | High | High | Clear navigation, comprehensive README |
| Examples don't work | Medium | High | Test every example before commit |
| Migration fails | Low | Critical | Provide rollback instructions |
| Documentation drift | High | Medium | Generate from code where possible |

## Rollback Strategy

If documentation causes confusion or errors:

1. **Immediate**: Add warning banner to affected docs
2. **Short-term**: Hotfix incorrect information
3. **Recovery**: 
   - Restore previous documentation version
   - Add clarification notices
   - Update with corrections
4. **Prevention**: Add documentation testing to CI/CD

## Validation Metrics

Track these to ensure documentation quality:

1. **Time to First Success**: Target <5 minutes
2. **Support Ticket Reduction**: Target 80% reduction
3. **Example Success Rate**: Target 100%
4. **Path Accuracy**: Target 100%
5. **Command Coverage**: Target 100%
6. **Error Coverage**: Target 100%

## Dependencies Between Phases

```
Phase 1 (Critical Path) 
    ↓
Phase 2 (User Docs) ←→ Phase 3 (Dev Docs)
    ↓
Phase 4 (Examples)
    ↓
Phase 5 (Release)
```

## Notes

- Phase 1 MUST be complete before any release
- Phases 2 and 3 can be worked in parallel
- Test all examples in clean environment
- Consider user perspective first, always
- Document actual implementation, not planned
