# Mikado Method Plan: Complete Production-Ready Documentation Cleanup and LEAN Optimization

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: MIK-DOC-001
- **Created**: 2025-08-21
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: Planning
- **Quality Gate Score Target**: >90/100

## Goal Statement
Transform the Task Orchestrator documentation to achieve production-grade quality (>90/100 score) by eliminating waste, fixing critical issues, and applying LEAN principles to maximize user value while minimizing maintenance burden.

## Success Criteria
1. Zero TODO markers in any public documentation
2. All internal documents properly archived/segregated
3. No duplicate content (merge overlapping guides)
4. Documentation quality score >90/100
5. All code examples tested and verified working
6. Zero broken links across all documentation
7. Clear separation between public and internal content

## Task Decomposition

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Immediate)
- [ ] Task 1.1: Remove TODO markers from API_REFERENCE.md
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Validation: `grep -n "TODO" docs/reference/API_REFERENCE.md` returns nothing
  
- [ ] Task 1.2: Move GITHUB-CLEANUP-STEPS.md to archive
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 10 minutes
  - Validation: File no longer in root, exists in archive/internal-docs/
  
- [ ] Task 1.3: Move MACPS-FRAMEWORK-ADDITION.md to archive
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 10 minutes
  - Validation: File no longer in root, exists in archive/internal-docs/

### Phase 2: Code Example Fixes
- [ ] Task 2.1: Audit all tm add examples in documentation
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 45 minutes
  - Validation: List of all examples with their locations
  
- [ ] Task 2.2: Update tm add examples to show correct output format
  - Dependencies: [2.1]
  - Estimated time: 60 minutes
  - Validation: Each example tested with actual tm command
  
- [ ] Task 2.3: Verify all code blocks are executable
  - Dependencies: [2.2]
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Validation: Copy-paste test of each code block succeeds

### Phase 3: LEAN Content Consolidation
- [ ] Task 3.1: Analyze deployment guide overlap
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 20 minutes
  - Validation: Overlap percentage documented
  
- [ ] Task 3.2: Merge TASK-ORCHESTRATOR-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md and REPOSITORY-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
  - Dependencies: [3.1]
  - Estimated time: 45 minutes
  - Validation: Single comprehensive deployment guide created
  
- [ ] Task 3.3: Consolidate Claude integration documentation
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 60 minutes
  - Validation: Single claude-integration.md with all content

### Phase 4: Quality Validation
- [ ] Task 4.1: Run comprehensive link validation
  - Dependencies: [1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 3.2, 3.3]
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: `./scripts/validate-all-doc-links.sh` passes
  
- [ ] Task 4.2: Run README quality validation
  - Dependencies: [2.2]
  - Estimated time: 10 minutes
  - Validation: `./scripts/validate-readme.sh README.md` scores >90
  
- [ ] Task 4.3: Final documentation quality gate check
  - Dependencies: [4.1, 4.2]
  - Estimated time: 20 minutes
  - Validation: Overall score >90/100

## Risk Analysis
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Breaking existing links | Medium | High | Create redirects or update all references |
| Losing important content during merge | Low | Medium | Review diffs carefully, keep backups |
| Code examples become outdated | Low | Low | Test each example before committing |
| User confusion from moved docs | Medium | Medium | Update README with new locations |

## Rollback Strategy
1. All changes tracked in git - easy revert if needed
2. Archive original files before moving/merging
3. Test documentation links before pushing
4. Keep mapping of old â†’ new locations
5. Can restore from git history if critical issues found
