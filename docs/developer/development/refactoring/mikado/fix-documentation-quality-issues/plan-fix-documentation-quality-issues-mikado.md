# Mikado Method Plan: Fix Documentation Quality Issues

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: MIK-001
- **Created**: 2025-08-23
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: Planning
- **Quality Gate Score**: 72/100 (Target: 85/100)

## Goal Statement
Fix all critical documentation quality issues identified in the quality gate report to achieve production-ready documentation with a quality score of 85+ and ensure all documentation is accurate, consistent, and valuable for users.

## Success Criteria
1. Version consistency across all documentation (v2.6.0)
2. All reference docs have implementation status headers
3. New v2.6.0 features (templates, wizard, hooks) fully documented
4. All critical code examples tested and working
5. Quality score improved from 72/100 to 85+/100
6. Zero broken links or invalid examples

## Task Decomposition

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (30 minutes)
- [ ] Task 1.1: Fix version inconsistencies
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 10 minutes
  - Validation: Run version consistency check script
  - Files affected: README.md, api-reference.md, all reference docs

- [ ] Task 1.2: Add status headers to reference docs
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: Verify all 18 reference docs have status headers
  - Template: `## Status: Implemented\n## Last Verified: August 23, 2025`

- [ ] Task 1.3: Create version consistency validation script
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 5 minutes
  - Validation: Script runs and reports all versions correctly

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates (1 hour)
- [ ] Task 2.1: Document wizard command in cli-commands.md
  - Dependencies: [1.1]
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: Examples work when executed
  - Content: tm wizard, tm wizard --quick

- [ ] Task 2.2: Document template commands in cli-commands.md
  - Dependencies: [1.1]
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: All template subcommands documented
  - Content: tm template list/show/apply

- [ ] Task 2.3: Document hooks performance commands
  - Dependencies: [1.1]
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: All hooks subcommands documented
  - Content: tm hooks report/alerts/thresholds/cleanup

- [ ] Task 2.4: Update api-reference.md with new v2.6.0 methods
  - Dependencies: [1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3]
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: All new classes/methods documented

### Phase 3: Validation & Testing (30 minutes)
- [ ] Task 3.1: Test all code examples in user-guide.md
  - Dependencies: [2.1, 2.2, 2.3]
  - Estimated time: 10 minutes
  - Validation: All examples execute without errors

- [ ] Task 3.2: Verify all documentation links
  - Dependencies: [1.1, 1.2]
  - Estimated time: 5 minutes
  - Validation: Run validate-all-doc-links.sh with zero errors

- [ ] Task 3.3: Update screenshots in user guide
  - Dependencies: [3.1]
  - Estimated time: 10 minutes
  - Validation: Screenshots match current UI/output

- [ ] Task 3.4: Run final quality gate check
  - Dependencies: [3.1, 3.2, 3.3]
  - Estimated time: 5 minutes
  - Validation: Quality score >= 85/100

## Risk Analysis
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Examples don't work with v2.6.0 | Medium | High | Test each example before documenting |
| Version drift in future | High | Medium | Create automated version check in CI |
| Missing new feature details | Low | Medium | Reference implementation files directly |
| Screenshots become outdated | High | Low | Use text-based examples where possible |

## Rollback Strategy
1. All changes are documentation-only (no code changes)
2. Git revert if any issues found
3. Previous documentation remains in git history
4. No production code affected
