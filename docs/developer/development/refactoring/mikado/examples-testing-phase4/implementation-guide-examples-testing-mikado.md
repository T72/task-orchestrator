## Quality Assurance Procedures

### Example Validation Process

**For each example created:**
1. **Clean Environment Test**:
   ```bash
   # Test in fresh directory
   mkdir /tmp/test_examples
   cd /tmp/test_examples
   git clone [repository]
   # Follow example exactly as written
   ```

2. **Platform Validation**:
   - Test on WSL environment
   - Verify commands work as expected
   - Check output formats match documentation

3. **Error Scenario Testing**:
   - Intentionally trigger documented error conditions
   - Verify resolution steps work as described
   - Ensure error messages match documentation

### Documentation Review Checklist

- [ ] **Technical Accuracy**: All commands and outputs verified
- [ ] **Clarity**: Instructions are unambiguous and complete
- [ ] **Completeness**: All necessary steps included
- [ ] **Formatting**: Consistent with project style guidelines
- [ ] **Links**: All internal and external links validated
- [ ] **Code Blocks**: Proper syntax highlighting applied
- [ ] **Examples**: All examples tested and working

### Integration Verification
