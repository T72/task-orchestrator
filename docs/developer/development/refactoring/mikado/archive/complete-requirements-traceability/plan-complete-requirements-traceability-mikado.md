# Mikado Method Plan: Complete Requirements Traceability

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: MIK-001
- **Created**: 2025-08-21
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: Planning

## Goal Statement
Achieve 90%+ requirements traceability score by addressing:
1. Add @implements annotations to 3 orphaned files (__init__.py, tm_orchestrator.py, tm_worker.py)
2. Implement 3 missing requirements (FR-024, FR-025, FR-026)
3. Validate final traceability score meets target

## Success Criteria
1. Overall traceability score ≥ 90%
2. Forward traceability ≥ 90% (≥22/24 requirements implemented)
3. Backward traceability ≥ 85% (≥8/10 files annotated)
4. All missing requirements have clear implementation evidence
5. Validation script passes with GREEN status

## Task Decomposition

### Phase 1: Investigation & Analysis
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Research missing requirements FR-024, FR-025, FR-026
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: Clear understanding of requirement specifications
  - Files to examine: docs/specifications/requirements/

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Analyze orphaned files for appropriate annotations
  - Dependencies: None  
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Validation: Mapped each file to relevant requirements
  - Files: src/__init__.py, src/tm_orchestrator.py, src/tm_worker.py

### Phase 2: Quick Wins (File Annotations)
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Add annotations to src/__init__.py
  - Dependencies: 1.2
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: File shows in requirements validation as "HAS REQUIREMENTS"

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Add annotations to src/tm_orchestrator.py
  - Dependencies: 1.2
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Validation: File shows in requirements validation as "HAS REQUIREMENTS"

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Add annotations to src/tm_worker.py
  - Dependencies: 1.2
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Validation: File shows in requirements validation as "HAS REQUIREMENTS"

### Phase 3: Missing Requirements Implementation
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Implement FR-024 requirement
  - Dependencies: 1.1, 2.1-2.3
  - Estimated time: 2-3 hours (varies by requirement complexity)
  - Validation: Requirement validation script shows FR-024 as IMPLEMENTED

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Implement FR-025 requirement  
  - Dependencies: 1.1, 3.1 (may have dependencies)
  - Estimated time: 2-3 hours
  - Validation: Requirement validation script shows FR-025 as IMPLEMENTED

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Implement FR-026 requirement
  - Dependencies: 1.1, 3.1-3.2 (may have dependencies)
  - Estimated time: 2-3 hours
  - Validation: Requirement validation script shows FR-026 as IMPLEMENTED

### Phase 4: Final Validation & Testing
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Run comprehensive requirements validation
  - Dependencies: All Phase 3 tasks
  - Estimated time: 15 minutes
  - Validation: ./scripts/validate-requirements.sh shows ≥90% score

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Run comprehensive test suite
  - Dependencies: 4.1
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes  
  - Validation: ./tests/test_comprehensive.sh passes 100%

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Update documentation
  - Dependencies: 4.1-4.2
  - Estimated time: 30 minutes
  - Validation: CLAUDE.md success patterns updated with traceability achievement

## Risk Analysis
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Missing requirements are complex features | Medium | High | Research thoroughly before implementation; start with simpler approaches |
| Requirements interdependent | Medium | Medium | Implement in logical order; validate dependencies during Phase 1 |
| Implementation breaks existing functionality | Low | High | Run tests after each implementation; commit incrementally |
| Annotations insufficient for validation script | Low | Medium | Test validation script after each annotation addition |

## Rollback Strategy
1. **Git-based rollback**: Each phase committed separately for granular rollback
2. **Incremental validation**: Run validation script after each major change
3. **Test safety net**: Comprehensive test suite validates no regression
4. **Documentation restore**: CLAUDE.md changes easily reversible

## Estimated Total Time
- **Phase 1**: 1.5 hours (investigation)
- **Phase 2**: 1.25 hours (annotations)  
- **Phase 3**: 6-9 hours (implementations, varies by requirement complexity)
- **Phase 4**: 1.25 hours (validation)
- **Total**: 10-13 hours over 2-3 sessions

## Dependencies on External Factors
- None (all work contained within project)
- Validation script already functional
- Test infrastructure already in place
