# Mikado Method Plan: Complete v2.1 Requirements to 85%

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: MIK-002
- **Created**: 2025-08-21
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Status**: Planning
- **Current Score**: 65%
- **Target Score**: 85%

## Goal Statement
Implement the remaining v2.1 Foundation Layer requirements to achieve 85% compliance, focusing on the 11 failing requirements identified during validation testing.

## Success Criteria
1. v2.1 validation score reaches 85% or higher
2. No regression in other PRD versions (v1.0, v2.0, v2.2, v2.3)
3. All implemented features have working tests
4. Performance overhead remains under 10ms
5. Documentation updated for new features

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Complex hook interactions | Medium | High | Test each hook in isolation first |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Profile and optimize hot paths |
| Breaking existing features | Low | High | Run regression tests frequently |
| Incomplete requirements understanding | Medium | Medium | Reference PRD v2.1 spec carefully |

## Rollback Strategy
1. All changes in separate commits
2. Feature flags for new functionality
3. Keep backup of working hooks
4. Test rollback procedure before major changes

## Total Estimated Time
11 hours (can be completed in 1-2 sessions)
