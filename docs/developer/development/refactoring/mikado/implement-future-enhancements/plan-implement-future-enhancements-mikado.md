# Mikado Method Plan: Implement Future Enhancements

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: MIK-ENHANCE-001
- **Created**: 2025-08-22
- **Estimated Complexity**: High
- **Status**: Planning
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (Nice-to-have features)

## Goal Statement
Implement three outstanding future enhancements to improve observability, team workflows, and user onboarding experience.

## Success Criteria
1. Hook performance monitoring provides actionable insights
2. Task templates reduce repetitive task creation by 50%
3. Interactive wizard helps new users set up in <2 minutes
4. All features are optional and don't affect existing workflows
5. Documentation and tests for all new features

## Task Decomposition

### Phase 2: Advanced Task Templates (FR-047)
- [ ] Task 2.1: Design template schema (YAML/JSON)
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: Schema supports variables, dependencies, metadata

  - Dependencies: [2.3]
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: tm template list/apply/create commands work

### Phase 3: Interactive Setup Wizard (FR-048)
- [ ] Task 3.1: Design wizard flow and prompts
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: Flow diagram covers all setup options
  
- [ ] Task 3.2: Implement interactive prompting
  - Dependencies: [3.1]
  - Estimated time: 2 hours
  - Validation: Clean input handling with validation

- [ ] Task 3.3: Create project type templates
  - Dependencies: [2.4]
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: Templates for web, CLI, library projects

- [ ] Task 3.4: Generate quick start guide
  - Dependencies: [3.2]
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: Customized guide based on selections

- [ ] Task 3.5: Add --interactive flag to init
  - Dependencies: [3.2, 3.3, 3.4]
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: tm init --interactive launches wizard

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Task 4.1: Write unit tests for all features
  - Dependencies: [1.4, 2.5, 3.5]
  - Estimated time: 3 hours
  - Validation: >80% coverage for new code
  
- [ ] Task 4.2: Create integration tests
  - Dependencies: [4.1]
  - Estimated time: 2 hours
  - Validation: End-to-end workflows tested

- [ ] Task 4.3: Update documentation
  - Dependencies: [4.1]
  - Estimated time: 2 hours
  - Validation: All features documented with examples

- [ ] Task 4.4: Performance validation
  - Dependencies: [4.2]
  - Estimated time: 1 hour
  - Validation: No performance regression

## Risk Analysis
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Template complexity grows | High | Medium | Start with simple schema, iterate |
| Performance monitoring overhead | Medium | High | Make it optional, use sampling |
| Wizard becomes annoying | Medium | Medium | Always provide --no-interactive option |
| Breaking existing workflows | Low | High | All features are opt-in |

## Rollback Strategy
1. All new features are behind feature flags
2. Can disable via config: `tm config --disable templates`
3. Telemetry can be turned off completely
4. Wizard is opt-in only with --interactive flag

## Time Estimate
- **Phase 1 (Monitoring)**: 7 hours
- **Phase 2 (Templates)**: 7 hours  
- **Phase 3 (Wizard)**: 6 hours
- **Phase 4 (Testing)**: 8 hours
- **Total Estimated Time**: 28 hours
- **Can be parallelized**: Yes (Phases 1-3 independent)

## Implementation Priority
1. **First**: Task Templates (FR-047) - Highest user value
2. **Second**: Interactive Wizard (FR-048) - Improves onboarding
3. **Third**: Performance Monitoring (FR-046) - Developer tool

## Dependencies Discovered
- Templates are prerequisite for wizard project types
- Telemetry storage uses similar structure to templates
- All features need config management extensions
