# CLAUDE.md - Your AI Dev Team Partner

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ⚠️ PROTECTED CONTENT NOTICE

**CRITICAL**: [X] Protected Rules with proven [metrics]. These MUST NOT be modified.

**Protected Rules Quick Reference**:
- **Rules [X-Y]** (Section): [Brief description]
- **Rules [A-B]** (Section): [Brief description]

Look for **[PROTECTED]** markers. Full details preserved inline. Only the user can modify these rules.

## 🎯 ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY

[Your project's #1 principle - make it memorable and clear]

## Key Points I Should Always Remember

[5-10 critical rules that guide every action]

1. **[RULE NAME IN CAPS]** - [Clear, actionable instruction]. [Why this matters]. [Consequence of not following].

2. **[PROTECTED RULE - DO NOT MODIFY] [RULE NAME]** - [Critical instruction that has proven value]. **⚠️ CRITICAL: This rule is PROTECTED because [specific proven benefit]. MUST NOT be removed, altered, or weakened. Established [date] after [validation event].**

[Continue numbered list...]

## Critical Rules - NEVER FORGET

[10-15 operational rules that prevent failures]

1. **[Category]: [Rule Name]** - [Specific instruction]
   - When: [Trigger condition]
   - How: [Implementation steps]
   - Verify: [How to check compliance]
   - Example: [Code or command example]

2. **[PROTECTED] [Rule Name]** - [Mission-critical instruction]
   **Protection Reason**: [Specific incident or metric]
   **Validation**: [How this was proven]
   **MUST**: [What must always happen]
   **NEVER**: [What must never happen]
```

## Protection Strategy Framework

### Level 1: Rule Categories and Priorities

```markdown
## Rule Classification System

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Protected) - NEVER MODIFY
Rules that prevent catastrophic failures or enable massive improvements.
- Marked with **[PROTECTED]**
- Include protection reason and validation
- Only user can override with explicit instruction

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - MODIFY WITH CAUTION
Important operational standards that significantly impact productivity.
- Review impact before changing
- Document reason for modification
- Test changes in isolated environment first

### 🟢 STANDARD - MODIFY AS NEEDED
Best practices and conventions that improve consistency.
- Update based on team consensus
- Keep aligned with industry standards
- Document in changelog

### ⚪ INFORMATIONAL - FREELY MODIFY
Guidelines, examples, and helpful tips.
- Update to reflect current practices
- Add new examples as discovered
- Remove outdated information
```

### Level 2: Protection Markers and Metadata

```markdown
## Protection Marker Standards

### Full Protection Block
```
X. **[PROTECTED RULE - DO NOT MODIFY] Rule Name**
   **Established**: YYYY-MM-DD
   **Validated By**: [Specific metric/incident]
   **Impact**: [Measurable improvement]
   **Dependencies**: [Other rules this enables]
   
   [Rule content]
   
   **⚠️ CRITICAL: This rule is PROTECTED because [reason]. 
   Proven results: [specific metrics]. 
   MUST NOT be removed without user approval.**
```

### Inline Protection
```
**[PROTECTED]** Always use [specific approach] for [scenario].
```

### Protection Metadata
Each protected rule should include:
- Date established
- Validation method (test/incident/metric)
- Quantified impact (percentage/time/count)
- Dependencies on other rules
- Rollback instructions if removed
```

### Level 3: Change Management Protocol

```markdown
## Rule Modification Protocol

### Adding New Rules

1. **Identify Pattern**: Rule needed when pattern occurs 3+ times
2. **Validate Impact**: Test rule in isolation first
3. **Classify Priority**: Assign appropriate level (Critical/High/Standard)
4. **Document Clearly**: Include When/How/Verify/Example
5. **Set Protection**: If proven >30% improvement, mark as PROTECTED

### Modifying Existing Rules

#### For PROTECTED Rules:
```bash
# FORBIDDEN - Will be rejected
"Update protected rule X to do Y instead"

# REQUIRED - Explicit override
"I explicitly approve modifying protected rule X because [specific reason]"
```

#### For Non-Protected Rules:
1. Document current rule's impact
2. Identify improvement opportunity
3. Test modification in isolation
4. Update with changelog entry
5. Monitor for regressions

### Removing Rules

#### Protected Rules - NEVER REMOVE
Protected rules can only be:
- Superseded by better protected rule
- Explicitly removed by user
- Moved to archived section with full history

#### Other Rules - Removal Criteria
Remove when:
- Technology/tool no longer used
- Better approach proven (>2x improvement)
- Creates more waste than value
- Conflicts with newer protected rule
```

### Level 4: Rule Organization Structure

```markdown
## Optimal Rule Organization

### 1. Protection Notice (Top of file)
Brief, scannable summary of protected content

### 2. Priority Hierarchy
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 ABSOLUTE TOP PRIORITY        │
│ The ONE rule above all others   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Key Points to Remember (5-10)   │
│ Including protected strategies  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Critical Rules (10-20)          │
│ Operational standards           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Domain-Specific Rules           │
│ Testing, Database, API, etc.    │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Patterns & Anti-Patterns        │
│ Do this, not that              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Rule Grouping Strategies

**By Lifecycle Phase**:
- Session Start Rules
- Development Rules  
- Testing Rules
- Deployment Rules

**By Domain**:
- Frontend Rules
- Backend Rules
- Database Rules
- Infrastructure Rules

**By Impact**:
- Performance Rules (speed)
- Quality Rules (correctness)
- Security Rules (safety)
- Efficiency Rules (productivity)
```

### Level 5: Protection Validation System

```markdown
## Rule Protection Validation

### Automated Protection Check
```python
# Include in your CI/CD or git hooks
def validate_protected_rules():
    """Ensure protected rules haven't been modified"""
    protected_patterns = [
        r'\[PROTECTED RULE - DO NOT MODIFY\]',
        r'\[PROTECTED\]',
        r'MUST NOT be removed'
    ]
    
    # Check CLAUDE.md for all protected markers
    # Alert if any protected content modified
    # Block commits that remove protected rules
```

### Manual Protection Audit (Weekly)
- [ ] Count total protected rules
- [ ] Verify each rule still applicable
- [ ] Check protection reasons still valid
- [ ] Review metrics/validation still true
- [ ] Document any needed updates

### Protection Effectiveness Metrics
Track monthly:
- Protected rules count
- Times protection prevented mistake
- Value delivered by protected rules
- Incidents from ignoring rules
```

## Real-World Protection Examples

### Example 1: Test Execution Protection

```markdown
### Before (Unprotected - Often Ignored)
"Use test server for test execution"

### After (Protected with Context)
**[PROTECTED RULE - DO NOT MODIFY] MANDATORY Test Server Bridge**
**Established**: 2025-07-15
**Validated By**: 300+ successful test sessions
**Impact**: 8x parallel execution, 75% time reduction

For ALL test execution, you MUST use Test Server Bridge at localhost:3456.
Direct test execution is FORBIDDEN - causes WSL/Windows conflicts.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This rule is PROTECTED because direct execution caused 
3-hour debug sessions. Test Server Bridge eliminated 95% of environment issues.
MUST NOT be removed without explicit user approval.**
```

### Example 2: Agent Deployment Protection

```markdown
### Before (Unprotected - Inconsistent)
"Deploy multiple agents for complex tasks"

### After (Protected with Proof)
**[PROTECTED] Parallel Agent Squadron is DEFAULT**
**Proven**: 4x-5x velocity improvement (300+ test fixes in 45 minutes)

For ANY multi-domain task, ALWAYS deploy 4+ specialized agents in parallel.
- Measured improvement: 58% reduction in task time
- Validated across 50+ deployments
- Zero benefit from serial deployment

**Protection Dependencies**: Requires Rules #10 (Task Orchestrator) and #11 (Baseline Measurement)
```

## Protection Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Over-Protection (Everything Protected)
```markdown
# WRONG - Too many protected rules
[PROTECTED] Use semicolons in JavaScript
[PROTECTED] Indent with 2 spaces
[PROTECTED] Name variables descriptively
```

### ✅ Strategic Protection (Proven Value)
```markdown
# RIGHT - Only protect high-impact proven rules
[PROTECTED] Test Server Bridge for all test execution (8x performance)
[PROTECTED] Parallel Squadron for multi-domain (4x velocity)
Standard: Code style follows team conventions
```

### ❌ Vague Protection Reasons
```markdown
# WRONG - No clear validation
[PROTECTED] Always do this because it's better
```

### ✅ Specific Protection Validation
```markdown
# RIGHT - Clear metrics and proof
[PROTECTED] Database migrations in supabase/migrations/ root
Validated: 3 production incidents from wrong location
Impact: 100% prevention of migration conflicts
```

## Quick Start for New Projects

### Step 1: Identify Your Critical Rules (Day 1)
```markdown
## Our Protected Rules Candidates

1. **Build Process**: [What must never break]
2. **Data Safety**: [What must never leak]
3. **Performance**: [What must stay fast]
4. **User Experience**: [What must work]
5. **Team Velocity**: [What multiplies productivity]
```

### Step 2: Validate Before Protection (Week 1)
```markdown
## Rule Validation Tracker

| Rule | Baseline | With Rule | Improvement | Protected? |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Test Server | 15 min | 2 min | 87% faster | YES ✅ |
| Code Review | 10 bugs | 3 bugs | 70% fewer | YES ✅ |
| Direct DB Access | 5 incidents | 0 incidents | 100% safer | YES ✅ |
| Style Guide | - | - | Consistency | NO ⚪ |
```

### Step 3: Implement Protection (Week 2)
