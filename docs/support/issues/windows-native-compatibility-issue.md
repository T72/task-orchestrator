# Issue: Task Orchestrator Windows Native Environment Compatibility

**Date**: 2025-08-27
**Reporter**: Claude Code (on behalf of RoleScoutPro-MVP project)
**Priority**: High
**Type**: Compatibility

## Issue Description

Task Orchestrator (`./tm`) requires adaptation for Windows native environment execution. Currently, the tool is a Python3 script with a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) that works in WSL/Linux but needs proper Windows support when Claude Code runs in native Windows mode.

## Current Situation

### Environment Details
- **Project**: RoleScoutPro-MVP
- **Location**: `D:\Dropbox\Private\Persönlich\VSCodeEnv\projects\IT ThinkTank Lab\RoleScoutPro-MVP`
- **Claude Code Mode**: Running in native Windows (not WSL)
- **Task Orchestrator Version**: v2.6.0-internal (deployed 2025-08-23)

### Problem
1. Python is not installed on the Windows system
2. The `./tm` command cannot execute directly in Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
3. All Claude Code hooks that reference `./tm` commands fail in Windows native environment

### Current Workarounds Created
As temporary solutions, we've created:
- `tm.bat` - Windows batch wrapper
- `tm.ps1` - PowerShell wrapper

These check for Python availability and provide error messages if Python is missing.

## Requirements for Windows Native Support

### Essential Features Needed

1. **Cross-platform execution** without requiring users to install Python separately
2. **Seamless integration** with Claude Code hooks in Windows environment
3. **Maintain all current functionality** including:
   - Task creation and management
   - Three-channel communication (share, note, discover)
   - Templates and wizard features
   - Hook performance monitoring

### Suggested Solutions (in order of preference)

1. **Node.js Implementation** 
   - Create a Node.js version of Task Orchestrator
   - Node.js is already installed and verified working
   - Would eliminate Python dependency entirely

2. **Bundled Executable**
   - Use PyInstaller or similar to create standalone `.exe`
   - No Python installation required by users
   - Single file distribution

3. **PowerShell Implementation**
   - Native Windows scripting solution
   - No additional dependencies
   - Best Windows integration

4. **Python Auto-installer**
   - Script that checks and installs Python if missing
   - Less ideal due to installation requirements

## Impact

### Affected Functionality
- All `Bash(./tm *)` commands in `.claude/settings.json` permissions
- Multi-agent coordination workflows
- Task tracking and orchestration
- Squadron deployment patterns

### Business Impact
- Reduced efficiency in Windows native environments
- Inability to use Task Orchestrator features without manual Python setup
- Breaks documented workflows in CLAUDE.md

## Test Environment Available

We're available to test any Windows native solutions in our environment:
- Windows 10/11
- Node.js installed: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`
- PowerShell 5.1+
- Working directory: `D:\Dropbox\Private\Persönlich\VSCodeEnv\projects\IT ThinkTank Lab\RoleScoutPro-MVP`

## Additional Context

All other hooks in the project have been successfully migrated to Windows native execution using PowerShell and Node.js. Task Orchestrator is the only remaining component requiring adaptation.

## Contact

For testing or clarification, solutions can be tested directly in the RoleScoutPro-MVP project environment.
