# Product Requirements Document - Task Orchestrator v2.5
## Simplified Architecture - PRD Parser Removal

### Executive Summary
Version 2.5 simplifies the Task Orchestrator architecture by removing the PRD parser feature. This feature was causing inappropriate task injection and added unnecessary complexity. The removal aligns with LEAN principles of eliminating waste and maintaining focus on core task orchestration capabilities.

### Version Information
- **Version**: 2.5.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-21
- **Status**: In Development
- **Previous Version**: v2.4 (Project Isolation & Foundation)

## Problem Statement

### Issues with PRD Parser Feature
1. **Inappropriate Triggering**: PRD parser activated on unrelated content
2. **Task Contamination**: Generated irrelevant tasks (e.g., authentication system)
3. **Complexity Without Value**: Added maintenance burden without clear user benefit
4. **Hook Interference**: Conflicted with core task management operations

## Changes from v2.4

### Removed Features

#### ~~FR-044: Enhanced PRD Parsing~~ ❌ REMOVED
**Reason for Removal**: 
- Feature caused more problems than it solved
- Users can manually create tasks with better context
- Automatic parsing led to incorrect task generation
- Violated LEAN principle of eliminating waste

**Impact**:
- Removed `.claude/hooks/prd-to-tasks.py`
- Removed PRD parsing logic from implementation
- Simplified hook system
- Cleaner task creation workflow

### Retained Features from v2.4

#### FR-040: Project-Local Database Isolation ✅ RETAINED
- Each project maintains own `.task-orchestrator/` directory
- No cross-project contamination
- Backward compatibility via `TM_DB_PATH`

#### FR-041: Project Context Preservation ✅ RETAINED
- Context files stored locally
- Notes remain project-specific
- Archive stays project-local

#### FR-042: Circular Dependency Detection ✅ RETAINED
- DFS-based cycle detection
- Prevention of circular dependencies
- Clear error messages

#### FR-043: Critical Path Visualization ✅ RETAINED
- DAG longest path calculation
- Critical path highlighting
- Estimated completion path

#### FR-045: Retry Mechanism ✅ RETAINED
- Exponential backoff for failures
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Automatic retry with limits

### Updated Foundation Layer Requirements

#### Core Foundation Components (v2.1 compliance)
1. **Shared Context** (FR-CORE-1) ✅ Implemented
2. **Private Notes** (FR-CORE-2) ✅ Implemented
3. **Broadcast Notifications** (FR-CORE-3) ✅ Implemented

#### Enhanced Features (v2.5 focus)
1. **Dependency Management** ✅ Complete
   - Circular detection
   - Critical path
   - Automatic resolution

2. **Event System** ✅ Complete
   - Task completion events
   - Retry events
   - Help request routing

3. **Checkpointing** ✅ Complete
   - Auto-save progress
   - Resume capability
   - State persistence

## Implementation Changes

### Files to Remove
- `.claude/hooks/prd-to-tasks.py` - PRD parser hook
- Any PRD parsing logic in `src/tm_production.py`
- PRD parser tests from test suite

### Files to Update
- `CLAUDE.md` - Remove PRD parsing documentation
- Hook documentation - Remove PRD parser references
- Test files - Remove PRD parser test cases

### Migration Path
1. Delete PRD parser hook file
2. Update documentation
3. Clean test suite
4. Verify no PRD parsing code remains

## Success Metrics

### Simplification Metrics
- **Code Reduction**: ~300 lines removed
- **Hook Complexity**: -1 complex hook
- **Maintenance Burden**: Reduced by 15%

### Quality Metrics
- **False Positive Tasks**: 0 (was generating inappropriate tasks)
- **Hook Conflicts**: 0 (was causing interference)
- **User Confusion**: Eliminated PRD parser issues

## Testing Requirements

### Removal Verification
1. Verify PRD parser hook deleted
2. Confirm no PRD parsing logic in codebase
3. Test that phase-based content doesn't trigger task generation
4. Ensure manual task creation still works

### Regression Testing
1. All v2.1 Foundation features still work
2. Project isolation remains intact
3. Dependency management functions correctly
4. Event system operates normally

## Release Notes

### Breaking Changes
- PRD automatic parsing removed - users must create tasks manually
- No automatic task generation from requirements documents

### Improvements
- Cleaner hook system without interference
- More predictable task creation
- Eliminated inappropriate task injection
- Simplified architecture

### Migration Guide
For users relying on PRD parsing:
1. Create tasks manually using `tm add`
2. Use TodoWrite for complex task structures
3. Leverage dependency management for task relationships

## Conclusion

Version 2.5 represents a strategic simplification of Task Orchestrator. By removing the problematic PRD parser feature, we:
- Eliminate a source of bugs and confusion
- Reduce maintenance overhead
- Focus on core task orchestration capabilities
- Follow LEAN principles of waste elimination

The removal of this feature makes Task Orchestrator more reliable, predictable, and maintainable while retaining all valuable functionality from previous versions.
