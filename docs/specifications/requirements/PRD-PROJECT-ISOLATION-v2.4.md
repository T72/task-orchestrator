# Product Requirements Document - Task Orchestrator v2.4
## Project Isolation & Foundation Layer Enhancement

### Executive Summary
Version 2.4 addresses critical architectural issues discovered during v2.3 deployment, primarily the lack of project isolation and incomplete Foundation Layer implementation. This release focuses on making Task Orchestrator truly usable for multi-project development.

### Version Information
- **Version**: 2.4.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-21
- **Status**: In Development
- **Previous Version**: v2.3 (Core Loop Enhancement)

## Problem Statement

### Critical Issues from v2.3
1. **Project Contamination**: All projects share global database at `~/.task-orchestrator/`
2. **Foundation Layer Gaps**: Only 56% of v2.1 Foundation requirements implemented
3. **Multi-Project Workflow**: Impossible to work on multiple projects simultaneously
4. **Context Switching**: Task bleeding causes confusion and errors

- Max 3 retries before escalation
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Target**: v2.1 FR4.2

**Requirement**: Zero data loss during v2.3 to v2.4 migration
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Automatic backup before migration
- Rollback capability
- Migration validation
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: ‚úÖ Documented

### Section 4: Integration Improvements

#### FR-046: Hook Performance Monitoring
**User Story**: As a developer, I need to know when hooks are slowing down operations.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Measure hook execution time
- Log slow hooks (>10ms)
- Performance dashboard in telemetry
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: ‚ùå Not Implemented

#### FR-047: Advanced Task Templates
**User Story**: As a team lead, I want reusable task templates for common workflows.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Define templates in YAML/JSON
- Instantiate with variables
- Share templates across team
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ‚ùå Not Implemented
**Note**: Mentioned in v2.3 roadmap

### Section 5: Documentation & Usability

#### FR-048: Interactive Setup Wizard
**User Story**: As a new user, I want guided setup for my first project.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Interactive tm init with prompts
- Project type selection
- Feature toggle configuration
- Quick start guide generation
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: ‚ùå Not Implemented

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Zero task contamination incidents
- 90%+ user satisfaction with isolation
- <5 minute setup for new projects

### Performance Metrics  
- Maintain <10ms hook overhead
- Support 100+ concurrent agents per project
- Database operations <5ms average

### Quality Metrics
- 90%+ requirements satisfaction (up from 81%)
- Zero data loss during migration
- 100% backward compatibility maintained

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Isolation (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ FR-040: Database isolation
- ‚úÖ NFR-006: Multi-project support
- ‚úÖ NFR-007: Migration safety

### Phase 2: Foundation Layer (IN PROGRESS)
- üîÑ FR-041: Context preservation
- ‚ùå FR-042: Circular dependency detection
- ‚ùå FR-043: Critical path visualization
- üîÑ FR-044: Enhanced PRD parsing
- ‚ùå FR-045: Retry mechanism

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (PLANNED)
- ‚ùå FR-046: Performance monitoring
- ‚ùå FR-047: Task templates
- ‚ùå FR-048: Setup wizard

## Migration Path

### From v2.3 to v2.4
1. **Default Change**: Database location moves to project-local
2. **Backward Compatible**: Set `TM_DB_PATH=~/.task-orchestrator` for old behavior
3. **Data Migration**: Optional tools to split global database by project

## Validation Criteria

### Requirement Validation
- Run all PRD validation scripts (v1.0 through v2.4)
- Target: >90% overall satisfaction
- Focus: v2.1 Foundation gaps (current 56%)

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Test project isolation
project1/tm add "Task A"
project2/tm list  # Should not show Task A

# Test migration compatibility
TM_DB_PATH=~/.task-orchestrator tm list  # Old tasks visible
unset TM_DB_PATH && tm list  # Only project tasks
```

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks
- **Migration Complexity**: Mitigated by environment variable override
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigated by local databases (faster than global)
- **Compatibility Break**: Mitigated by TM_DB_PATH backward compatibility

### User Experience Risks
- **Confusion on Upgrade**: Mitigated by clear migration guide
- **Lost Tasks**: Mitigated by keeping global database intact
- **Setup Complexity**: Mitigated by zero-config defaults

## Approval

### Stakeholders
- Development Team: ‚úÖ Approved (critical fix needed)
- User Community: ‚úÖ Implicit (fixes reported issues)
- Project Owner: ‚úÖ Pre-approved (fixes fundamental flaw)
