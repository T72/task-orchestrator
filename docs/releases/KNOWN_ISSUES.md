# Known Issues - Task Orchestrator v1.0.0

This document lists known limitations and issues in the current release. These are planned for resolution in future versions.

## Edge Case Test Failures (6/43 tests)

### Input Validation Issues

**Issue**: Invalid priority validation (Test 7)
- **Description**: System doesn't properly reject invalid priority values
- **Impact**: Low - Invalid values may be stored but don't affect functionality
- **Workaround**: Use only valid priorities: low, medium, high, critical
- **Planned Fix**: v1.1.0

**Issue**: Invalid status validation (Test 19)  
- **Description**: System doesn't properly reject invalid status values
- **Impact**: Low - Invalid values may be stored but don't affect workflow
- **Workaround**: Use only valid statuses: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked, cancelled
- **Planned Fix**: v1.1.0

### Scalability Limitations

**Issue**: Too many file references (Test 17)
- **Description**: Performance degrades with >10 file references per task
- **Impact**: Medium - May cause slower response times
- **Workaround**: Limit file references to essential files only
- **Planned Fix**: v1.2.0

**Issue**: Too many tags (Test 30)
- **Description**: System performance degrades with >20 tags per task
- **Impact**: Medium - May cause slower response times  
- **Workaround**: Use focused, specific tags (limit to <10 per task)
- **Planned Fix**: v1.2.0

**Issue**: Large task descriptions (Test 40)
- **Description**: Descriptions >5000 characters are rejected
- **Impact**: Low - Most task descriptions are much shorter
- **Workaround**: Keep descriptions concise, use file references for details
- **Planned Fix**: v1.1.0

### Missing Features

**Issue**: Audit log not created (Test 39)
- **Description**: Detailed audit logging not implemented in v1.0.0
- **Impact**: Medium - No detailed change history tracking
- **Workaround**: Use git history and export functionality for tracking
- **Planned Fix**: v1.3.0

## Performance Issues

### High Concurrency Limitations

**Issue**: Database locking contention
- **Description**: Performance degrades with >50 parallel operations
- **Impact**: Medium - May cause timeouts in high-concurrency environments
- **Workaround**: Limit parallel operations, use sequential processing for bulk operations
- **Planned Fix**: v1.2.0

**Issue**: Bulk operation timeouts  
- **Description**: Operations with >100 tasks may timeout
- **Impact**: Medium - Affects large-scale task management
- **Workaround**: Process in smaller batches (<50 tasks)
- **Planned Fix**: v1.2.0

## Context Sharing Features

**Issue**: Advanced context sharing not available
- **Description**: Enhanced collaboration features from development versions not included
- **Impact**: Low - Basic task sharing works, advanced features planned
- **Workaround**: Use standard task assignment and notification features
- **Planned Fix**: v1.4.0

## Reporting and Analytics

Currently planned for future releases:
- Advanced reporting dashboards
- Task analytics and metrics
- Time tracking capabilities
- Bulk import/export functionality

## Migration Notes

- Successfully migrates from `.task-manager` to `.task-orchestrator` directories
- Database schema stable for v1.x series
- Configuration format may evolve in v2.0

## Workaround Summary

For production use of v1.0.0:
1. Limit file references to <10 per task
2. Use <10 tags per task
3. Keep descriptions under 1000 characters
4. Process bulk operations in batches of <50
5. Use valid priority/status values only
6. Monitor concurrent usage in high-traffic environments

## Support

If you encounter issues not listed here:
1. Check existing GitHub issues
2. Create a new issue with reproduction steps
3. Include system information and logs
4. Tag as "bug" for defects or "enhancement" for new features
