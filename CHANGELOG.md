- Single file references: `--file src/auth.py:42`
- File range references: `--file src/utils.py:100:150`
- Multiple file references per task
- File reference preservation in task details

#### Notifications & Impact (2 Features)
- `tm watch` - Real-time notification monitoring
- `--impact-review` flag for completion impact analysis
- Broadcast notifications for critical discoveries
- Agent-specific and global notifications

#### Advanced Filtering (3 Features)
- `--status` filter for task status (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- `--assignee` filter for agent-specific tasks
- `--has-deps` filter for tasks with dependencies
- Combination filters for complex queries

#### Export Capabilities (2 Features)
- JSON export with complete task data
- Markdown export with formatted sections by status
- TSV export for spreadsheet compatibility

#### 🚀 Collaboration Features (6 Commands) - NEW!
- `tm join` - Join task collaboration with shared context

## Migration Guide (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

### Database Migration
```bash
# Export existing tasks
./tm export --format json > tasks_backup.json

# Remove old database
rm -rf .task-orchestrator

# Initialize new database
./tm init

# Manual re-import required (or use migration script)
```

### Command Changes
- `--tags` replaced with file references via `--file`
- Status values now validated (must be: pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- Priority values now validated (must be: low, medium, high, critical)

### New Features to Explore
1. Try collaboration: `tm join <task_id>` then `tm share <task_id> "message"`
2. Use filtering: `tm list --status pending --assignee alice`
3. Impact review: `tm complete <task_id> --impact-review`
4. Notifications: `tm watch` to see recent events
