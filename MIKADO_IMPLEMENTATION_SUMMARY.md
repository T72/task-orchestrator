# Mikado Method Implementation Summary

## Objective
Replace all placeholder implementations with actual functionality in Task Orchestrator.

## Completed Implementations

### 1. Watch Command Implementation ✅

**Previous State**: 
- Placeholder comment: `# Placeholder for watch command - no-op for now`
- Command did nothing when called

**Implemented Solution**:
- Added `notifications` table to database schema
- Created `watch()` method in tm_production.py
- Implemented notification creation for:
  - Task unblocking when dependencies complete
  - Critical discoveries (broadcast to all agents)
- Added notification display in wrapper script
- Notifications are marked as read after viewing

**Features**:
- Shows recent unread notifications
- Agent-specific and broadcast notifications
- Automatic notification on task unblocking
- Discovery notifications alert all agents
- Time-stamped notifications

### 2. Discovery Command Enhancement ✅

**Previous State**:
- Basic implementation without notifications
- No way for other agents to know about critical discoveries

**Implemented Solution**:
- Enhanced `discover()` method to create broadcast notifications
- All agents see discovery notifications via `watch`
- Maintains backward compatibility with context sharing

### 3. Database Schema Updates ✅

**Added Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notifications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    agent_id TEXT,
    task_id TEXT,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    read BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0
)
```

### 4. Fixed Command Routing ✅

**Previous Issues**:
- Duplicate TaskManager initialization
- Inconsistent routing between collaboration and production modules
- Indentation errors in wrapper script

**Solution**:
- Single TaskManager initialization at start
- Proper routing for discover command to use production version
- Fixed all indentation issues in wrapper script

## Testing Results

### Notification System Test
```bash
# Create discovery
./tm discover task_id "Critical issue"
# Result: Discovery shared and notification created

# Check notifications
./tm watch
# Result: Shows discovery notification with timestamp

# Complete task with dependencies
./tm complete task_id
# Result: Dependent tasks unblocked and notified

# Check notifications for unblocking
./tm watch  
# Result: Shows unblock notification
```

### All Tests Passing
- Watch command works correctly
- Notifications are created and displayed
- Unblocking creates appropriate notifications
- Discovery broadcasts to all agents
- No more placeholder messages

## Architecture Benefits

### For Multi-Agent Orchestration
1. **Real-time Awareness**: Agents immediately know when their tasks are ready
2. **Critical Issue Broadcasting**: Discoveries reach all agents instantly
3. **Asynchronous Coordination**: No polling needed - watch shows what's new
4. **Audit Trail**: All notifications timestamped for tracking

### For the Example Task Structure
Given the phased specialist tasks in user-prompt-submit-hook:
- Phase 1 database specialists complete tasks
- Backend specialists run `watch` and see their tasks unblocked
- Any critical discoveries alert all specialists
- Perfect for orchestrator monitoring overall progress

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **No More Placeholders**: All commands have real implementations
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with helpful messages  
3. **Database Transactions**: Proper commit/rollback handling
4. **Type Hints**: Maintained throughout new code
5. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings for new methods

## Commands Now Fully Implemented

| Command | Previous State | Current State |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `watch` | Placeholder/no-op | Shows notifications, marks as read |
| `discover` | Basic share | Creates broadcast notifications |
| All others | Working | Enhanced with notification support |

## System Readiness

The Task Orchestrator is now **fully functional** with no placeholder implementations remaining. The notification system adds crucial real-time coordination capabilities perfect for multi-agent orchestration scenarios.

### Key Capabilities for Orchestration:
- ✅ Real-time task status awareness
- ✅ Broadcast critical discoveries
- ✅ Automatic dependency unblocking notifications
- ✅ Agent-specific and system-wide notifications
- ✅ Complete audit trail with timestamps

## Conclusion

Successfully executed the Mikado method to replace all placeholders with production-ready implementations. The Task Orchestrator now provides a complete, robust notification system ideal for coordinating multiple specialized agents working on complex, interdependent tasks.
